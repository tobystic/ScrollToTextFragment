Abstract: Scroll To Text adds support for specifying a text snippet in the URL
    fragment. When navigating to a URL with such a fragment, the browser will
    find the first instance of the text snippet and scroll it into view.

# Introduction # {#introduction}

<div class='note'>This section is non-normative</div>

## Use cases ## {#use-cases}

### Web text references ### {#web-text-references}
The core use case for scroll to text is to allow URLs to serve as an exact text
reference across the web. For example, Wikipedia references could link to the
exact text they are quoting from a page. Similarly, search engines can serve
URLs that direct the user to the answer they are looking for in the page rather
than linking to the top of the page.

### User sharing ### {#user-sharing}
With scroll to text, browsers may implement an option to 'Copy URL to here'
when the user opens the context menu on a text selection. The browser can
then generate a URL with the text selection appropriately specified, and the
recipient of the URL will have the text scrolled into view and visually
indicated.  Without scroll to text, if a user wants to share a passage of text
from a page, they would likely just copy and paste the passage, in which case
the receiver loses the context of the page.

# Description # {#description}

## Syntax ## {#syntax}

<div class='note'>This section is non-normative</div>

A [=text fragment directive=] is specified in the [=fragment directive=] (see
[[#the-fragment-directive]]) with the following format:
<pre>
#:~:text=[prefix-,]textStart[,textEnd][,-suffix]
          context  |-------match-----|  context
</pre>
<em>(Square brackets indicate an optional parameter)</em>

The text parameters are percent-decoded before matching. Dash (-), ampersand
(&), and comma (,) characters in text parameters must be percent-encoded to
avoid being interpreted as part of the text directive syntax.

The only required parameter is textStart. If only textStart is specified, the
first instance of this exact text string is the target text.

<div class="example">
<code>#:~:text=an%20example%20text%20fragment</code> indicates that the
exact text "an example text fragment" is the target text.
</div>

If the textEnd parameter is also specified, then the text directive refers to a
range of text in the page. The target text range is the text range starting at
the first instance of startText, until the first instance of endText that
appears after startText. This is equivalent to specifying the entire text range
in the startText parameter, but allows the URL to avoid being bloated with a
long text directive.

<div class="example">
<code>#:~:text=an%20example,text%20fragment</code> indicates that the first
instance of "an example" until the following first instance of "text fragment"
is the target text.
</div>

### Context Terms ### {#context-terms}

<div class='note'>This section is non-normative</div>

The other two optional parameters are context terms. They are specified by the
dash (-) character succeeding the prefix and preceding the suffix, to
differentiate them from the textStart and textEnd parameters, as any
combination of optional parameters may be specified.

Context terms are used to disambiguate the target text fragment. The context
terms can specify the text immediately before (prefix) and immediately after
(suffix) the text fragment, allowing for whitespace.

<div class="note">
While the context terms must be the immediate text surrounding the target text
fragment, any amount of whitespace is allowed between context terms and the
text fragment. This helps allow context terms to be across element boundaries,
for example if the target text fragment is at the beginning of a paragraph and
it must be disambiguated by the previous element's text as a prefix.
</div>

The context terms are not part of the target text fragment and must not be
visually indicated or affect the scroll position.

<div class="example">
<code>#:~:text=this%20is-,an%20example,-text%20fragment</code> would match
to "an example" in "this is an example text fragment", but not match to "an
example" in "here is an example text".
</div>

## The Fragment Directive ## {#the-fragment-directive}
To avoid compatibility issues with usage of existing URL fragments, this spec
introduces the [=fragment directive=]. The [=fragment directive=] is a portion
of the URL fragment delimited by the code sequence <code>:~:</code>. It is
reserved for UA instructions, such as text=, and is stripped from the URL
during loading so that author scripts can't directly interact with it.

The [=fragment directive=] is a mechanism for URLs to specify instructions meant
for the UA rather than the document. It's meant to avoid direct interaction with
author script so that future UA instructions can be added without fear of
introducing breaking changes to existing content. Potential examples could be:
translation-hints or enabling accessibility features.

### Parsing the fragment directive ### {#parsing-the-fragment-directive}

To the definition of a <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url">
URL record</a>, add:

<em>
A [[URL#concept-url|URL]]'s <dfn lt="URL's fragment directive">fragment
directive</dfn> is either null or an ASCII string holding data used by the UA to
process the resource. It is initially null.
</em>

The <dfn>fragment directive delimiter</dfn> is the string ":~:", that is the
three consecutive code points U+003A (:), U+007E (~), U+003A (:).

The <dfn>fragment directive</dfn> is the part of the URL fragment that follows
the [=fragment directive delimiter=].

<div class="note">
  The [=fragment directive=] is part of the URL fragment. This means it must
  always appear after a U+0023 (#) code point in a URL. 
</div>

<div class="example">
  To add a [=fragment directive=] to a URL like https://example.com, a fragment
  must first be appended to the URL: https://example.com#:~:text=foo.
</div>

Amend the <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-basic-url-parser">
basic URL parser</a> steps to parse the [=fragment directive=] in a URL:

  - In step 11 of this algorithm, amend the [[URL#fragment-state|fragment
    state]] case:
    - In the inner switch on [[URL#c|c]], in the Otherwise case, add a step
        after step 2:
        - If [[URL#c|c]] is U+003A (:) and
            <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#remaining">remaining</a>
            begins with the two consecutive code points U+007E (~) and U+003A
            (:), set state to [=fragment directive state=]. Increment 
            <em>pointer</em> by the length of the [=fragment directive
            delimiter=] minus 1.
    - Step 3 (now step 4 after the above change) must begin with "Otherwise,"
  - In step 11 of this algorithm, add a new [=fragment directive state=]
    case with the following steps:
    
    <dfn>fragment directive state</dfn>:
    - Switching on [[URL#c|c]]:
        - The EOF code point: Do nothing
        - U+0000 NULL: Validation error
        - Otherwise:
            1. If [[URL#c|c]] is not a URL code point and not U+0025 (%),
                validation error.
            2. If [[URL#c|c]] is U+0025 (%) and
                <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#remaining">remaining</a>
                does not start with two ASCII hex digits, validation error.
            3. UTF-8 percent encode [[URL#c|c]] using the fragment
                percent-encode set and append the result to [=URL's fragment
                directive=].

<div class="note">
  These changes make a URL's fragment end at the [=fragment directive
  delimiter=]. The [=fragment directive=] includes all characters that follow,
  but not including, the delimiter.
</div>

<div class="example">
<code>https://example.org/#test:~:text=foo</code> will be parsed such that
the fragment is the string "test" and the [=fragment directive=] is the string
"text=foo".
</div>

### Serializing the fragment directive ### {#serializing-the-fragment-directive}

Amend the <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-serializing">URL serializer
</a> steps by inserting a step after step 7:

8. If the <em>exclude fragment flag</em> is unset and [=URL's fragment
    directive=] is non-null:
    1. If [[URL#concept-url-fragment|url's fragment]] is null, append U+0023 (#)
        to <em>output</em>.
    2. Append ":~:", followed by [=URL's fragment directive=], to
        <em>output</em>.

### Processing the fragment directive ### {#processing-the-fragment-directive}

To the definition of
<a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document-type">Document</a>, add:

<em>
Each document has an associated <dfn lt="Document's fragment directive">fragment
directive</dfn>.
</em>

Amend the
<a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsing-the-web.html#initialise-the-document-object">
create and initialize a Document object</a> steps to store and remove the
[=fragment directive=] from the Document's [[DOM#concept-document-url|URL]].

Replace steps 7 and 8 of this algorithm with:

7. Let <em>url</em> be null
8. If <em>request</em> is non-null, then set <em>document</em>'s
    [[DOM#concept-document-url|URL]] to <em>request</em>'s
    [[FETCH#concept-request-current-url|current URL]].
9. Otherwise, set <em>url</em> to <em>response</em>'s
    [[FETCH#concept-response-url|URL]].
10. Set [=Document's fragment directive=] to [=URL's fragment directive=].
    (Note: this is stored on the document but not web-exposed)
11. Set [=URL's fragment directive=] to null.
12. Set <em>document</em>'s [[DOM#concept-document-url|URL]] to be <em>url</em>.

### Fragment directive grammar ### {#fragment-directive-grammar}
A <dfn>valid fragment directive</dfn> is a sequence of characters that appears
in the [=fragment directive=] that matches the production:
<dl>
<code><dt><dfn>FragmentDirective</dfn> ::=</dt>
<dd>[=TextDirective=] ("&" [=TextDirective=])*</dd></code>
</dl>

<div class="note">
The [=FragmentDirective=] may contain multiple directives split by the "&"
character. Currently this means we allow multiple text directives to enable
multiple indicated strings in the page, but this also allows for future
directive types to be added and combined.
</div>

The <dfn>text fragment directive</dfn> is one such [=fragment directive=] that
enables specifying a piece of text on the page, that matches the production:

<dl>
<code><dt><dfn>TextDirective</dfn> ::=</dt><dd>"text="
[=TextDirectiveParameters=]</dd></code>

<code><dt><dfn>TextDirectiveParameters</dfn> ::=</dt><dd>
([=TextDirectivePrefix=] ",")? [=TextMatchString=] ("," [=TextMatchString=])?
("," [=TextDirectiveSuffix=])?</dd></code>

<code><dt><dfn>TextDirectivePrefix</dfn> ::=</dt><dd>[=TextMatchString=]
"-"</dd></code>

<code><dt><dfn>TextDirectiveSuffix</dfn> ::=</dt><dd>"-"
[=TextMatchString=]</dd></code>

<code><dt><dfn>TextMatchString</dfn> ::=</dt><dd>([=TextMatchChar=] |
[=PercentEncodedChar=])+</dd></code>

<code><dt><dfn>TextMatchChar</dfn> ::=</dt><dd>[a-zA-Z0-9] | "!" | "$" | "'" |
"(" | ")" | "*" | "+" | "." | "/" | ":" | ";" | "=" | "?" | "@" | "_" | "~"</dd>
</code>

<div class = "note">
A [=TextMatchChar=] may be any
<a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-code-points">URL code point</a> that
is not explicitly used in the [=TextDirective=] syntax, that is "&", "-", and
",", which must be percent-encoded.
</div>
<code><dt><dfn>PercentEncodedChar</dfn> ::=</dt><dd>"%" [a-zA-Z0-9]+</dd></code>
</dl>

## Security and Privacy ## {#allow-text-fragment-directives}

### Motivation ### {#motivation}

<div class="note">This section is non-normative</div>

Care must be taken when implementing [=text fragment directive=] so that it
cannot be used to exfiltrate information across origins. Scripts can navigate
a page to a cross-origin URL with a [=text fragment directive=].  If a malicious
actor can determine that a victim page scrolled after such a navigation, they
can infer the existence of any text on the page.

In addition, the user's privacy should be ensured even from the destination
origin.  Although scripts on that page can already learn a lot about a user's
actions, a [=text fragment directive=] can still contain sensitive information.
For this reason, this specification provides no way for a page to extract the
content of the text fragment anchor. User agents must not expose this
information to the page.

<div class="example">
  A user visiting a page listing dozens of medical conditions may have gotten
  there via a link with a [=text fragment directive=] containing a specific
  condition. This information must not be shared with the page.
</div>

### Should Allow Text Fragment ### {#should-allow-text-fragment}

<div class="note">
This algorithm has input <em>window, is user triggered</em> and returns a
boolean indicating whether a [=text fragment directive=] should be allowed to
invoke.
</div>

1. If any of the following conditions are true, return false.
    * <em>window</em>'s
        <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#dom-parent">
        parent</a> field is non-null.
    * <em>window</em>'s
        <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#dom-opener">
        opener</a> field is non-null.
    * The <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#document">Document</a> of the
        [[HTML#latest-entry|latest entry]] in <em>window</em>'s
        [[HTML#browsing-context|browsing context]]'s
        [[HTML#session-history|session history]] is equal to <em>window</em>'s
        document.
        <div class="note">
        That is, this is the result of a same document navigation
        </div>
    * <em>is user triggered</em> is false.
2. Otherwise, return true.


## Navigating to a Text Fragment ## {#navigating-to-text-fragment}
<div class="note">
The scroll to text specification proposes an amendment to
[[html#scroll-to-fragid]]. In summary, if a [=text fragment directive=] is
present and a match is found in the page, the text fragment takes precedent over
the element fragment as the indicated part of the document.
</div>

Add the following steps to the beginning of the processing model for <a
href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsing-the-web.html#the-indicated-part-of-the-document">
The indicated part of the document</a>.

1. Let <em>fragment directive string</em> be the document [=URL's fragment
    directive=].
2. Let <em>is user activated</em> be true if the current navigation was <a
    href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#triggered-by-user-activation"> triggered
    by user activation</a>
    <div class="note">
    TODO: This might need an additional flag somewhere to track the user
    activation triggering
    </div>
3. If the result of [[#should-allow-text-fragment]] with the window of the
    document's browsing context and <em>is user activated</em> is true then:
    1. If [[#find-a-target-text]] with <em>fragment directive string</em>
        returns non-null, then the return value is the indicated part of the
        document; return.

### Find a target text ### {#find-a-target-text}

To find the target text for a given string <em>fragment directive input</em>,
the user agent must run these steps:
1. If <em>fragment directive input</em> does not begin with the string "text=",
    then return null.
2. Let <em>raw target text</em> be the substring of <em>fragment directive
    input</em> starting at index 5.
    <div class="note">
    This is the remainder of the <em>fragment directive input</em> following,
    but not including, the "text=" prefix.
    </div>
3. If <em>raw target text</em> is the empty string, return null.
4. Let <em>tokens</em> be a [[INFRA#list|list]] of strings that is the result of
    [[INFRA#split-on-commas|splitting a string on commas]] of <em>raw target
    text</em>.
5. Let <em>prefix</em> and <em>suffix</em> and <em>textEnd</em> be the empty
    string.
    <div class="note">
    prefix, suffix, and textEnd are the optional parameters of the text
    directive.
    </div>
6. Let <em>potential prefix</em> be the first item of <em>tokens</em>.
7. If the last character of <em>potential prefix</em> is U+002D (-), then:
    1. Set <em>prefix</em> to the result of removing the last character from
        <em>potential prefix</em>.
    2. [[INFRA#list-remove|Remove]] the first item of the list <em>tokens</em>.
8. Let <em>potential suffix</em> be the last item of <em>tokens</em>.
9. If the first character of <em>potential suffix</em> is U+002D (-), then:
    1. Set <em>suffix</em> to the result of removing the first character from
        <em>potential suffix</em>.
    2. [[INFRA#list-remove|Remove]] the last item of the list <em>tokens</em>.
10. Assert: <em>tokens</em> has [[INFRA#list-size|size]] 1 or <em>tokens</em>
    has [[INFRA#list-size|size]] 2.
    <div class="note">
    Once the prefix and suffix are removed from tokens, tokens may either
    contain one item (textStart) or two items (textStart and textEnd).
    </div>
11. Let <em>textStart</em> be the first item of <em>tokens</em>.
12. If <em>tokens</em> has [[INFRA#list-size|size]] 2, then let <em>textEnd</em>
    be the last item of <em>tokens</em>.
    <div class="note">
    The strings prefix, textStart, textEnd, and suffix now contain the
    text directive parameters as defined in [[#syntax]].
    </div>
13. Let <em>walker</em> be a
    [[DOM#treewalker|TreeWalker]] equal to
    [[DOM#dom-document-createtreewalker|Document.createTreeWalker()]].
14. Let <em>position</em> be a [[INFRA#string-position-variable|position
    variable]] that indicates a text offset in
    <em>walker.currentNode.innerText</em>.
15. If textEnd is the empty string, then:
    1. Let <em>match position</em> be the result of [[#find-match-with-context]]
        with input walker <em>walker</em>, search position <em>position</em>,
        prefix <em>prefix</em>, query <em>textStart</em>, and suffix
        <em>suffix</em>.
    2. If <em>match position</em> is null, then return null.
    3. Let <em>match</em> be a Range in <em>walker.currentNode</em> with
        position <em>match position</em> and length equal to the length of
        <em>textStart</em>.
    4. Return <em>match</em>.
16. Otherwise, let <em>potential start position</em> be the result of
    [[#find-match-with-context]] with input walker <em>walker</em>, start
    position <em>position</em>, prefix <em>prefix</em>, query
    <em>textStart</em>, and suffix <em>null</em>.
17. If <em>potential start position</em> is null, then return null.
18. Let <em>end position</em> be the result of [[#find-match-with-context]] with
    input walker <em>walker</em>, search position <em>potential start
    position</em>, prefix <em>null</em>, query <em>textEnd</em>, and suffix
    <em>suffix</em>.
19. If <em>end position</em> is null, then return null.
20. Advance <em>end position</em> by the length of <em>textEnd</em>.
21. Let <em>match</em> be a Range in <em>walker.currentNode</em> with start 
    position <em>potential start position</em> and length equal to <em>end
    position - start position</em>.
22. Return <em>match</em>.

        <em>text</em>.
    2. Let <em>range</em> be a Range with position <em>start position</em> and
        length equal to the length of <em>query</em>.
    3. Using locale <em>locale</em>, let <em>left bound</em> be the last word
        boundary in <em>text</em> before <em>range</em>.
    4. Using locale <em>locale</em>, let <em>right bound</em> be the first word
        boundary in <em>text</em> after <em>range</em>.
        <div class="note">
          <p>
            Limiting matching to word boundaries is one of the mitigations to
            limit cross-origin information leakage. A word boundary is as
            defined in the <a
            href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Word_Boundaries">Unicode
            text segmentation annex</a>. The <a
            href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Default_Word_Boundaries">
            Default Word Boundary Specification</a> defines a default set of
            what constitutes a word boundary, but as the specification mentions,
            a more sophisticated algorithm should be used based on the
            <em>locale</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dictionary-based word bounding should take specific care in
            locales without a word-separating character (e.g. space). In
            those cases, and where the alphabet contains fewer than 100
            characters, the dictionary must not contain more than 20% of the
            alphabet as valid, one-letter words.
          </p>
        </div>
    5. If <em>left bound</em> immediately precedes <em>range</em> and <em>right
        bound</em> immediately follows <em>range</em>, then return
        <em>range</em>.
2. Return <em>null</em>.

## Indicating The Text Match ## {#indicating-the-text-match}

In addition to scrolling the text fragment into view as part of the <a
href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsing-the-web.html#try-to-scroll-to-the-fragment">
Try To Scroll To The Fragment</a> steps, the UA should visually indicate the
matched text in some way such that the user is made aware of the text match.

The UA should provide to the user some method of dismissing the match, such
that the matched text no longer appears visually indicated.

The exact appearance and mechanics of the indication are left as UA-defined.
However, the UA must not use the Document's <a
href="https://w3c.github.io/selection-api/#dfn-selection">selection</a> to
indicate the text match as doing so could allow attack vectors for content
exfiltration.

The UA must not visually indicate any provided context terms.

## Feature Detectability ## {#feature-detectability}

For feature detectability, we propose adding a new FragmentDirective interface
that is exposed via <code>window.location.fragmentDirective</code> if the UA
supports the feature.

<pre class='idl'>
interface FragmentDirective {
};
</pre>

We amend
<a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/history.html#the-location-interface">
The Location Interface</a> to include a <code>fragmentDirective</code> property:

<pre class='idl'>
interface Location {
    readonly attribute FragmentDirective fragmentDirective;
};
</pre>

# Generating Text Fragment Directives # {#generating-text-fragment-directives}

<div class='note'>
  This section is non-normative.
</div>

This section contains recommendations for UAs automatically generating URLs
with a [=text fragment directive=]. These recommendations aren't normative but
are provided to ensure generated URLs result in maximally stable and usable
URLs.

## Prefer Exact Matching To Range-based ## {#prefer-exact-matching-to-range-based}

The match text can be provided either as an exact string "text=foo%20bar%20baz"
or as a range "text=foo,bar".

UAs should prefer to specify the entire string where practical. This ensures
that if the destination page is removed or changed, the intended destination can
still be derived from the URL itself.

<div class='example'>
  Suppose we wish to craft a URL to
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing quoting the sentence:

  <pre>
    The first recorded idea of using digital electronics for computing was the
    1931 paper "The Use of Thyratrons for High Speed Automatic Counting of
    Physical Phenomena" by C. E. Wynn-Williams.
  </pre>

  We could create a range-based match like so:

  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing#:~:text=The%20first%20recorded,Williams">
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing#:~:text=The%20first%20recorded,Williams</a>

  Or we could encode the entire sentence using an exact match term:

  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing#:~:text=The%20first%20recorded%20idea%20of%20using%20digital%20electronics%20for%20computing%20was%20the%201931%20paper%20%22The%20Use%20of%20Thyratrons%20for%20High%20Speed%20Automatic%20Counting%20of%20Physical%20Phenomena%22%20by%20C.%20E.%20Wynn-Williams">
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing#:~:text=The%20first%20recorded%20idea%20of%20using%20digital%20electronics%20for%20computing%20was%20the%201931%20paper%20%22The%20Use%20of%20Thyratrons%20for%20High%20Speed%20Automatic%20Counting%20of%20Physical%20Phenomena%22%20by%20C.%20E.%20Wynn-Williams</a>

  The range-based match is less stable, meaning that if the page is changed to
  include another instance of "The first recorded" somewhere earlier in the
  page, the link will now target an unintended text snippet.

  The range-based match is also less useful semantically. If the page is
  changed to remove the sentence, the user won't know what the intended
  target was. In the exact match case, the user can read, or the UA can
  surface, the text that was being searched for but not found.
</div>

Range-based matches can be helpful when the quoted text is excessively long
and encoding the entire string would produce an unwieldly URL.

It is recommended that text snippets shorter than 300 characters always be
encoded using an exact match. Above this limit, the UA should encode the string
as a range-based match.

<div class='note'>
  TODO:  Can we determine the above limit in some more objective way?
</div>

## Use Context Only When Necessary ## {#use-context-only-when-necessary}

Context terms allow the [=text fragment directive=] to disambiguate text
snippets on a page. However, their use can make the URL more brittle in some
cases. Often, the desired string will start or end at an element boundary. The
context will therefore exist in an adjacent element. Changes to the page
structure could invalidate the [=text fragment directive=] since the context and
match text may no longer appear to be adjacent.

<div class='example'>
  Suppose we wish to craft a URL for the following text:

  <pre>
        &lt;div class="section"&gt;HEADER&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="content"&gt;Text to quote&lt;/div&gt;
  </pre>

  We could craft the [=text fragment directive=] as follows:

  <pre>
    text=HEADER-,Text%20to%20quote
  </pre>

  However, suppose the page changes to add a "[edit]" link beside all section
  headers. This would now break the URL.
</div>

Where a text snippet is long enough and unique, a UA should prefer to avoid
adding superfluous context terms.

It is recommended that context should be used only if one of the following is
true:
<ul>
  <li>The UA determines the quoted text is ambiguous</li>
  <li>The quoted text contains 3 or fewer words</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
  TODO: Determine the numeric limit above in a more objective way
</div>

## Determine If Fragment Id Is Needed ## {#determine-if-fragment-id-is-needed}

When the UA navigates to a URL containing a [=text fragment directive=], it will
fallback to scrolling into view a regular element-id based fragment if it
exists and the text fragment isn't found.

This can be useful to provide a fallback, in case the text in the document
changes, invalidating the [=text fragment directive=].

<div class='example'>
  Suppose we wish to craft a URL to
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing quoting the sentence:

  <pre>
    The earliest known tool for use in computation is the Sumerian abacus
  </pre>

  By specifying the section that the text appears in, we ensure that, if the
  text is changed or removed, the user will still be pointed to the relevant
  section:

  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing#Early_computation:~:text=The%20earliest%20known%20tool%20for%20use%20in%20computation%20is%20the%20Sumerian%20abacus">
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing#Early_computation:~:text=The%20earliest%20known%20tool%20for%20use%20in%20computation%20is%20the%20Sumerian%20abacus</a>
</div>

However, UAs should take care that the fallback element-id fragment is the
correct one:

<div class='example'>
  Suppose the user navigates to
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing#Early_computation. They
  now scroll down to the Symbolic Computations section. There, they select a
  text snippet and choose to create a URL to it:

  <pre>
    By the late 1960s, computer systems could perform symbolic algebraic
    manipulations
  </pre>

  The UA should note that, even though the current URL of the page is:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing#Early_computation, using
  #Early_computation as a fallback is inappropriate. If the above sentence is
  changed or removed, the page will load in the #Early_computation section
  which could be quite confusing to the user.

  If the UA cannot reliably determine an appropriate fragment to fallback to,
  it should remove the fragment id from the URL:

  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing#:~:text=By%20the%20late%201960s,%20computer%20systems%20could%20perform%20symbolic%20algebraic%20manipulations">
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing#:~:text=By%20the%20late%201960s,%20computer%20systems%20could%20perform%20symbolic%20algebraic%20manipulations</a>
</div>
